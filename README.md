Code Splitting is a performance optimization technique in React that breaks a large bundle into smaller chunks.

It helps load only the required code when a user visits a page, improving initial load time.

React supports code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense.

Components are loaded dynamically instead of at application startup.

It is especially useful for large applications and route-based loading.

Reduces unnecessary JavaScript execution on first render.

Works well with React Router for lazy-loading routes.

Improves user experience by faster page rendering.

Helps optimize bandwidth usage and application scalability.
